Hello!

This repository contains some docker-compose-files for modified but 
easier deployment of the fiware core plattform ([https://www.fiware.org/]) 

Before you ask many many questions. 
An extended tutorial how to use the plattform and extended services please 
check [https://fiware-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html]

After that I glad to explain the modification in comparison to the tutorial.

Have fun to try it out!

Thanks for any comments on it!
