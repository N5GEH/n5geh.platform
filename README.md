Hello!

This repository contains some docker-compose-files for modified but <br>
easier deployment of the fiware core plattform (https://www.fiware.org/) <br>

Before you ask many many questions. <br>
An extended tutorial how to use the plattform and extended services please <br>
check https://fiware-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html <br>

After that I glad to explain the modification in comparison to the tutorial. <br>

Have fun to try it out!<br>

Thanks for any comments on it!
